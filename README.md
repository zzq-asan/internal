# Internal

A basic internal cheat for the game Growtopia written in Odin.

Compiling:
```
odin build . -build-mode=dll
```

Testing:
You can find the Pre-Built DLL "internal.dll" on the base directory.

Features:
* Variant List logging (function calls)
* Packet logging (send/recieve)
* Message logging (console: binary adds [ZZQ INTERNAL] to every message)
* Automatic unban
* Version bypass (DLL is for 3.36 but works with 3.37)
